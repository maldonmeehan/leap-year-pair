# _EPICODUS STUDENT PROJECT | BDD Practice: Build a leap-year checker_

#### _Leap Year Checker, June 8, 2016_

#### By _**Marty Fitchen, Maldon Meehan, Epicodus**_

## Description

_This is an Epicodus student project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather an input and check if it is a leap year (using back-end logic). This is an lesson in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to learn to code using just the least amount of clean code to establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs. In addition, adding behaviors that will ignore various user inputs (i.e., " ", a, B, !, etc.)._

* _The program should return when a year is not a leap year._
  * _Input Example: 1993_
  * _Output Example: false_
* _The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years._
  * _Input Example: 2004_
  * _Output Example: true_
* _The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years._
  * _Input Example: 1900_
  * _Output Example: false_
* _The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 400, since those are leap years._
  * _Input Example: 2000_
  * _Output Example: true_
* _The program should return 'false' for inputted letters (which would then include full words [real or not] and sentences, such as "Nineteen Ninety Nine")._
    * _Input Example: a (or A)_
    * _Output Example: false_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Establish an internet connection_
* _Open a web browser_
* _Visit (Marty's) GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/mfitchen/leap-year">https://github.com/mfitchen/leap-year</a>_
* _Visit (Maldon's) GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/maldonmeehan/leap-year-pair">https://github.com/maldonmeehan/leap-year-pair</a>_
* _Enter a year and have fun!_

## Known Bugs

* _Any user input other than a year currently returns "NaN is not a leap year"._
